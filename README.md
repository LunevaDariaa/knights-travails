# knights-travails

Knight Moves is a JavaScript implementation of a breadth-first search algorithm to find the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard from a starting square to a finishing square.

## Overview

This project provides a function `knightTraversal` that takes the starting and finishing squares as input and outputs the shortest path the knight will take to reach the finishing square.

## Usage

To use the `knightTraversal` function, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Include the `knightTraversal` function in your JavaScript code.
3. Call the `knightTraversal` function with the starting and finishing squares as arguments.

Example usage:

```javascript
const start = [0, 0];
const finish = [7, 7];
knightTraversal(start, finish);
```
